A friend of mine takes a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (where n > 0). Within that sequence, he chooses two numbers, a and b. He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, excluding a and b. Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
